# Hello-World
Welcome! My Name is Sharon Lewis.

This is my first foray into GitHub and so far I like it a lot. 
The instructions are clear, the exercise is useful and i already feel like I know more than I did. 

I'll be using Git Hub to practice a few first forays into plugin or app coding. It's been a long time since I coded anything so it feels a little like starting over from scratch.
